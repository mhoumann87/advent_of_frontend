# Brief

In this project, we're going to create a credit card form

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# Users should be able to:

_NOTE: All interactivity must be handled through JavaScript. In this challenge, we are only writing the HTML and CSS._

- When the user finishes (blur) entering a credit card number, change the credit card image to match the type of card they entered. You can add a class of `visa`, `mastercard`, `discover`, or `american`
  - American Express cards always begin with the number 3- more specifically 34 or 37.
  - Visa cards begin with the number 4.
  - Mastercards start with the number 5.
  - Discover Cards begin with the number 6.
- When the user enters the CVV number, have the card flip over by adding a class of `flip`.

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework or libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
