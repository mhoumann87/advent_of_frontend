# **Brief**

In this project, we're going to create a toaster pop-up.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# **Users should be able to:**

- See a toaster pop-up in the bottom left corner of the screen
- There should be a title, paragraph of text, and form for signing up for the newsletter.
- There should be a close button at the top
- The [Compressed.fm](http://Compressed.fm) album artwork should be on the edge of the toaster pop-up

# **Need some support on this challenge?**

- Upgrade to the [Solution Tier](http://adventofcss.com). You'll get a video explanation from Amy.
- Join [the Learn Build Teach Discord](http://learnbuildteach.com) community. We have a separate channel set up specifically for the Advent of JavaScript.

# **Getting Started**

1. To get started, [download the zip file](https://store.selfteach.me/products/home). This includes all the project assets you need to get started: Figma file, images, and a style guide.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofcss**

# **Taking your Project to the Next Level**

- Use a framework or libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Hide the toaster pop-up by clicking on the close button. (_HINT: This can be accomplished in CSS with a checkbox._)
- Try adding interactivity by participating in the Advent of JavaScript

# **FAQs**

- Can I use libraries/frameworks on these projects?
  - Of course! We're providing the solution in vanilla HTML and CSS, but you can use whatever tools and frameworks you'd like.
- Oh no! I'm stuck!
  - Check out the [Learn Build Teach Discord](http://learnbuildteach.com). We have a specific channel set up, just for the Advent of JavaScript.
- Can I use this project in my portfolio?
  - Sure! But, be honest about the work that *you* did
