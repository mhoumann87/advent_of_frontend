# **Brief**

In this project, we're going to create a table of data.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# **Users should be able to:**

- Display 10 entries of data preloaded into **app.js**
- Sort columns ascending or descending by ID, Name, Email Address, and Job Title
- Click on the edit button and the row will show the content in an inline form. Changes can be confirmed by clicking on the check button.
- Users can view the next page of data (if you’re not on the last page already) by clicking on the next arrow (bottom right).
- Users can view the previous page of data (if you’re not on the first page) by clicking on the previous arrow (bottom right).
- The user can jump to a specific page by changing the number in the pagination text field (bottom right). Data is updated as soon as the user clicks off the input (blur).
- The total number of results is displayed (bottom left).

# **Getting Started**

1. To get started, [download the zip file](https://store.selfteach.me/products/home). This includes all the project assets you need to get started: Figma file, images, and a style guide.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofcss**

# **Taking your Project to the Next Level**

- Use a framework or libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Provide the ability to add a new entry.

# **FAQs**

- Can I use libraries/frameworks on these projects?
  - Of course! We're providing the solution in vanilla HTML and CSS, but you can use whatever tools and frameworks you'd like.
- Oh no! I'm stuck!
  - Check out the [Learn Build Teach Discord](http://learnbuildteach.com). We have a specific channel set up, just for the Advent of JavaScript.
- Can I use this project in my portfolio?
  - Sure! But, be honest about the work that *you* did
